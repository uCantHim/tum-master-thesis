I thank my supervisor Prof.\ Bhatotia for granting me the opportunity to work at his chair, as well as Sebastian and
Theo for their direct support on the thesis and their excellent project management efforts. My gratitude goes out to
Chris for his unwavering companionship on the grind to my greatest achievement at TUM.
