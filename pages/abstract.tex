Emulators are important pieces of software, though naturally prone to errors and difficult to debug. As the output of
emulators are programs, one can use symbolic execution to verify the correctness of that output and find errors in the
translation. This thesis proposes \textit{Focaccia}, an automatic testing tool for emulators based on this principle. It
designs and implements a fully working prototype and explores advantages and shortcoming of this approach.
