\chapter{Future Work}

One could look into a replacement strategy for symbolic execution, as that is currently Focaccia's strongest weakness.
Section~\ref{sec:comparison} hinted towards a possible alternative: generate a small program that sets up processor and
memory state, runs an instruction on it, and then reads back the result: Use the ISA's hardware implementation as the
oracle. The hardware, after all, is much more likely to have high correctness than a software emulator. One could even
re-use the reproducer's mechanism, which does pretty much exactly that.
